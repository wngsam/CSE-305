Project for CSE 305 - Principles of Database Systems from Fall 2014

This project is an unfinished dating website for CSE 305 using MySQL, GlassFish, Spring, Hibernate and various front-end languages.
The provided MySQL dump contains a working database with preloaded data and is required for the application to work.

This project was made by a group of 3 including myself.
I was responsible for some basic front-end design and some communication work between the application and database.
I also wrote the initial SQL code (modified from the professor's version) and the data insertion. Another member encrypted the passwords.
